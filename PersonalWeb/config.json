            "bio" : "Hi! My name is Alex Wang. I am currently a third year student studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Prior to studying at Ann Arbor, I had barely written a single line of code. In fact, I barely even understood how powerful code was. However, everything changed once I arrived at Michigan. After taking the introductory programming course in my first year in college, I quickly realized that programming was, and still is, something I enjoyed doing. I find satisfaction in solving challenges through completing projects, and I have always put forth the time and effort to ensure everything I do is of high quality. Outside of programming, some of my favorite hobbies include playing video games, watching NBA and NFL games, and playing basketball and ping pong.",
